        <h1>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website. </h1> <br/>
        <p> And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's. </p> <br/>

             <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit. </h2> <br/>
             <h4>7 fucking declarations.</h4> <br/>
             <p>  That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a
                href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website: </p> <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Shit's <em> still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
                    <li> <em>Still </em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
                    <li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
                    <li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
                    <li>Shit's <em> still </em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
                    </ul> <br/> 

                    <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3> <br/>
                    <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p> <br/>
                    
                    <h1>Let it breathe</h1> <br />
                    <p>Let it breathe</p> <br>
                    <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p> <br/>

                    <h1>A little less contrast</h1> <br/>
                    <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p> <br>

                    <h1>Size Matters</h1>
                    <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.></p> <br/>

                    <h1>Line-width, motherfucker</h1>
                    <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.></p> <br/>

                    <h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
                    <p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" >this site's inspiration </a>  What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit. </p><br/>
